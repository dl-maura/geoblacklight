This image is part of a larger series covering the entire state that was undertaken in 1951-1952 by William P. MacConnell (Class of 1943) in the Department of Forestry and Wildlife Management, University of Massachusetts Amherst. The purpose of the program was to capture photography that could be used to map forests, agricultural fields, wetlands, and other land cover across Massachusetts. The photograph was scanned and manually georeferenced in ArcMap 10.8 against 2019 color orthoimagery from the U.S. Geological Survey.",
